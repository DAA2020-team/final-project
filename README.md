## Usage
### Requirements
#### Python
The lower python version which these files have been tested is 3.6.9. Compatibility should not be a problem, assuming that a not too old version is used.

#### Dependencies
In order to run these file, it is necessary to install the [iso4217](https://pypi.org/project/iso4217/) ([github repository](https://github.com/dahlia/iso4217)) module for python. 
This module is used in order to get real ISO4217 codes and to check that the codes added are valid. 
It can be installed using pip, running the following command: 

`pip install iso4217`

### Exercise 1

1. Change directory to the root folder.
2. Run `python exercise1/main.py`

### Exercise 2

1. Change directory to the root folder.
2. Run `python exercise2/main.py`
    * This will test the function using the EUR denominations with a small amount (less than 5 is advisable).
    If needed, modify the amount and the currency in the file.
    * The algorithm implementation is inside this file.

### Exercise 3

1. Change directory to the root folder.
2. Run `python exercise3/main.py`

### Exercise 4

1. Change directory to the root folder.
2. Run `python exercise4/main.py`
